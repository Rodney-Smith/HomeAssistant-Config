#  @description    :  This integration can expose regular REST commands as
#                     services. Services can be called from a script or in
#                     automation.

# Including Directories
# !include_dir_list will return the content of a directory as a list with each
#    file content being an entry in the list. The list entries are ordered based
#    on the alphanumeric ordering of the names of the files.
# !include_dir_named will return the content of a directory as a dictionary
#    which maps filename => content of file.
# !include_dir_merge_list will return the content of a directory as a list by
#    merging all files (which should contain a list) into 1 big list.
# !include_dir_merge_named will return the content of a directory as a
#    dictionary by loading each file and merging it into 1 big dictionary.
